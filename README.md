# Data-Driven Design of Nanoscale Features to Obtain High-zT Thermoelectrics 

This repository contains data sets and code used for the paper titled above. In this study, methods for improving efficiency of thermoelectric materials are explored through a statistical learning-based investigation into design of optimal structural features. Structure, composition, dimensionality, and corresponding thermoelectric properties are extracted from 57 different thermoelectric materials systems publications (experimental) and compiled into a database. Feature selection methods such as ANOVA, lasso regression and PCA are used to refine the dataset and remove unimportant features that have negligible impact on the features. Afterwards, extra trees, nonlinear SVM, and Gaussian process regressors are built on the data set, with the efficacy of each evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation error. Finally, experimental design is implemented to verify the model and globally optimize the thermoelectric target property response surfaces.
